        Larry Kudlow, director of the US National Economic Council, recently said, "I think if they keep moving the way they're moving, they're on the wrong side of history. They're not the Soviet Union, but this kind of government control, statism, never works for long." His comments were made public on Wednesday in a report from Sinclair Broadcast Group.

        It would be interesting to learn why Kudlow thinks China is on the wrong side of history while the US is supposedly on its right side. Could one explanation be because the Trump administration started a trade war or once again raised tariffs, efforts which history has proven will become obsolete?

        Look at what the Trump administration has done so far. They despise the multilateral international trading system, claiming major economies have used it to take advantage of the US. They have launched successive attacks on other multilateral systems while withdrawing from UNESCO, the Iran nuclear deal and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia. Their actions have created unprecedented chaos to international order unheard of since the start of the new millennium.

        The US launched the biggest trade war against China in the history of the world. Its impact has severely impaired the global supply chain and threatened worldwide economic prospects.

        The US is also the first superpower to embrace populism, and has done so by repeatedly declaring its "US first" policy to the world. This has been one of the most devastating blows to economic globalization ever delivered by Washington.

        There is little chance any country would sincerely believe that the US is on the right side of anything. At least half of the US population, if not more, believes their country has made huge mistakes, while the remaining half can only see the immediate gains without considering future development or whether their country is right or wrong. Perhaps the fairest way the White House can think of is how they can secure victory for next year's presidential election.
